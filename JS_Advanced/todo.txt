Use the Array.reduce() method to calculate the total price of all products in shoppingCart.

Also take into account the quantity property of an item by multiplying the quantity times the price.

Make sure to work with an initial value, as you would otherwise not be able to retrieve the price & quantity from the first item unless you add some unnecessary code.

    Log the results in the console. It should be 35.41.
