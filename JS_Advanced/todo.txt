Create a callback function that checks if a number is an even number and returns true or false.

    Tip: You can use the remainder operator (%) to check what is left over when the number before the operator is divided by the number after the operator. E.g. 11 % 5 = 1.

Create a callback function that checks if a number is an odd number and returns true or false.

Create a filter function that takes an array and callback function as parameters.

Inside the filter function, loop over the array and check if a number is odd or even by passing it to the callback function.

    If the callback function returns true, store the number in a result array and return the result array at the end of the function.

Now, to check that your code works:

Create an array of numbers. E.g. [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

Call the filter function twice and pass the number array and the callback functions.

Log the results to see if you get a filtered array
