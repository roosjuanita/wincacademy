3. If the expiration date for their creditcard is before July of 2022, go to
step 2.

Thoughts:

This kinda feels like multiple steps:
* grab/read the credit card expiration date from the person object
* compare the expiration date with the current date
* conditionally do something if the expiration date is in the future or past

Let's break it down into multiple steps, see below.

Code thoughts:
We will need to grab the date from the credit_card property from the person object.

The date is a string like "4/22" or "12/26". The current date is July 16 2022.
Luckily our "today" is always the same.

I don't think we need the day because the credit card expiration date is for
a specific month.

We cannot simply do "4/22" > "7/22". We probably want to compare the year and
the month separately. So that means we need to grab the month part of this
string and convert it to a number and do the same for the year.

We're also lucky that there are no credit card expiration dates from before
2000 or else we'd have trouble comparing "4/22" and "4/99".

If the expiration happened before July 2022 we should look at the next person.
We could do this with a for or for .. of loop an if-statement and a
continue-statement, but array.filter is actually a good method to use because
we need to *filter* out items from the array and keep the rest.

3b. Compare the date with current date.

Thoughts:
Mostly code thoughts.

Code thoughts:
Because we massaged the data we should put the current date in the same form.
This should definitely be a function.

Because we also compare for sorting, let's use one function for comparing and
have that function return -1, 0 or 1 because that's also what
array.sort expects.

Then we can create a function around this compare function that returns a boolean
that tells us if one date is later than another. (a wrapper function)

Thoughts:
So now we have a shorter list. But that it's shorter doesn't really matter for
this step.

Code thoughts:
We definitely need to use array.sort. But we do need to pass in a callback
function to compare persons because otherwise it doesn't know how to order.

In this step again we need to grab the date out of a person object and again
compare it. This does sound a bit repetitive. We could use a function to do this.

But.. if we're going to do this, we should probably massage/enrich the data
before step 3 so we can do step 3 and 5 a lot more easily.
See the concept for more info on this "massaging/enriching" of data.

So let's introduce step 2.5
