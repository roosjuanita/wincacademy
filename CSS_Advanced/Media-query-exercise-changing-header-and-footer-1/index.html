                Oh. Hey, hey, Doc, where are you? And Jack Benny is secretary of the Treasury. We do now. Look, you gotta listen to me. Hi, Marty. George. Lorraine, are you up there? Uh Doc, uh no. No, don't be silly. Uh, coast guard. Hey Biff, check out this guy's life
                preserver, dork thinks he's gonna drown. Crazy drunk drivers. Hello. I need fuel. Go ahead, quick, get in the car. Ah well, sort of.

                Hey I'm talking to you, McFly, you Irish bug. Breakfast. What? George, there's nothing to be scared of. All it takes is a little self confidence. You know, if you put your mind to it, you could accomplish anything. He's fine, and he's completely unaware
                that anything happened. As far as he's concerned the trip was instantaneous. That's why Einstein's watch is exactly one minute behind mine. He skipped over that minute to instantly arrive at this moment in time. Come here, I'll show you
                how it works. First, you turn the time circuits on. This readout tell you where you're going, this one tells you where you are, this one tells you where you were. You imput the destination time on this keypad. Say, you wanna see the signing
                of the declaration of independence, or witness the birth or Christ.

                Here's a red-letter date in the history of science, November 5, 1955. Yes, of course, November 5, 1955. Right. In that case, I'll tell you strait out. Listen, Doc. Yeah, I'll keep that in mind. I swiped it from the old lady's liquor cabinet.
